## Is Grace centralized or decentralized?

Grace is a centralized version control system (VCS).

## I thought centralized version control systems were really slow.

Well, that's not a question... but... yeah, in some ways, the older centralized VCS's could feel slower, and heavier, especially when dealing with branches.

Grace is not like that. Grace is new, modern, lightweight, and very fast.

## Why did you create Grace?

In the 2022 StackOverflow Developer Survey ‚Äì the most recent one where they tracked version control usage ‚Äì Git was at 93.87% adoption. Git has won, no doubt.

And there's sort-of nowhere for it to go but down.

I've been around long enough to see different technologies rise and fall. Some have shorter market cycles (web UI frameworks, for instance), and some have longer market cycles, like hierarchical -> relational -> No-SQL databases, or popular social media apps. I've seen technologies that had almost 95% market share, with very long cycles, like Windows and Windows Server, eventually lose market share for one reason or another.

Git is 19 years old now. It doesn't have the easiest UX, to say the least. Many projects are exploring version control right now to see where it might go next. Git won't stay near 95% forever. Nothing ever does.

The thing that's probably going to take Git down is monorepos. Although I think large monorepos are a terrible idea ‚Äì and I strongly recommend that you use multiple code repositories and proper versioning with a package or artifact repository ‚Äì the trend right now is toward monorepos. Git doesn't do monorepos well, or, to be more precise, Git only does monorepos well by breaking the original contract of Git as a distributed VCS by using partial clones, or filtered partial clones, and therefore treating Git as a centralized VCS.

Of course, if you're using GitHub or GitLab or Azure DevOps, you're already doing centralized version control, you're just doing it with a decentralized VCS with bad UX, which doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it.

Grace is my offering to that search for what's next. Grace's design is my attempt to bring ease-of-use into a corner of our world that hasn't had much of that lately, and to connect us together in a different way than ever before.

## I like the way Git does branches.

Again with the not-question... I do too. I think that the lightweight branching in Git is one of the major reasons that it won.

That's why I kept lightweight branching in Grace. Create and delete branches to your heart's content.

## What about when I'm disconnected?

Well, you won't be able to run many Grace commands. And you probably won't be able to do lots of other things that you usually do.

More and more of us rely on cloud services and connectivity to the Internet just to do our jobs. Think about this: if your Internet connection went down, could you continue to do your job as a developer, or would you have to stop? Some of you could keep working, but if you can't, not having a connection to your source control server is the least of your concerns compared to not having a connection to Azure or AWS or wherever your cloud stuff is... not to mention Copilot and StackOverflow and your favorite search engine.

With the growth of satellite Internet, we're connecting more and more of the world at high-enough bandwidth to use centralized version control without issue. And I'm not designing for the 0.000001% "but I'm on a flight without Internet" scenario.

If being able to use local version control while you're not connected to the Internet is an important scenario for you, please use Git. It's great at that. I'm guessing that there's still a small ‚Äì important, but small ‚Äì percentage of programmers in the world that _really_ need that. For the rest of us, the vast majority of us, assuming a working Internet connection isn't a concern in 2024, and will be even less of a concern in 2026, 2028, etc.

Anyway, Grace won't stop you from continuing to edit the local copies of your files that you already have. When your Internet connection resumes, `grace watch` will catch you up immediately.

## Have you thought about using blockchain to...

No. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just... no.

## Can Grace do live two-way synchronization with Git repositories?

No, it can't. Two-way synchronization is a non-goal.

One-time initial import from a Git repo will be supported, and point-in-time export to a `git bundle` file will be supported, but not continuous two-way synchronization.

Grace just has a fundamentally different design than Git. That's intentional. Two-way synchronization would involve a messy translation between what Git calls a _merge_ and what Grace calls a _promotion_, and I don't see a good way right now to handle that well without writing a _lot_ of code and handling a _lot_ of edge cases, and that's time better spent on everything else that still needs doing.

Also, I don't think that new version control systems need to sync with Git to catch on. Git didn't have two-way sync with any of the VCS's that we all migrated from, and it didn't stop us from changing over. We did the migrations over some weekend, and Monday morning we were using Git, and we got on with our lives.

## What are the scalability limits for Grace?

### Hopeful answer

It depends on the PaaS services that Grace is deployed on. In general, Grace itself is very fast, and will take advantage of the speed and scale of the underlying cloud services it depends on.

I know Microsoft Azure well, so when I think about running Grace on services like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, Azure Monitor, and others, I look at Grace Server as orchestrating the usage of insanely high-scale PaaS products, and that's exactly what it's designed to do.

The stateless nature of Grace Server, and the use of the Actor Pattern, should allow for a significant number of concurrent users without too much hassle. In particular, Grace is designed so that data that the server needs when you run common CLI commands will already be in-memory most of the time. If it's not, that data will usually be under 10ms away in a document database.

The only load testing that I've done saturated my personal [Azure Cosmos DB Request Units](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units), but didn't stress Grace Server at all, which is what I expected. I haven't tested higher than 10,000 RU's, but I expect that when I do, I'll find some things to improve, and then Grace should be able to handle thousands of transactions/second.

### Actual current answer

I haven't done any truly high-scale load testing yet. I'm not sure.

I _can_ tell you that I've tested repositories of up to 100,000 files and 15,000 directories, with Grace deployed using Azure CosmosDB and Azure Blob Storage. If `grace watch` is running, client performance for most commands on those large repositories is around 0.8-1.0s (which includes 1 or 2 80ms roundtrips to the Azure data center). Performance on small- and medium-sized repositories is around 0.6-0.8s. Grace Server performance is unaffected by repository size for most commands. These times are from debug builds.

I've also tested individual file sizes up to 10GB. I'm not sure that 10GB files should fall under the purview of version control‚Äìthey should probably be versioned blobs in an object storage service ‚Äì but we'll see what happens. Grace doesn't have a technical limitation on file size (it's a uint64).

Each command, on its own, runs quickly enough to make me happy. I hope they all still do at scale.

## What does Grace borrow from Git?

A lot of things.

Grace keeps the ephemeral working directory, and the idea of a `.grace/objects` directory for each repo.

Grace keeps the lightweight branching, so you can continue to create and discard branches just as quickly as we do in Git.

Grace borrows the use of SHA-256 values as the hash function to uniquely identify files and directories.

We even borrowed the algorithm to decide if a file is text or binary.[^binary]

And much more. Grace owes a debt of gratitude to Git and to its maintainers.

## What about the other new version control projects?

There are a few really good VCS projects going on right now. It's exciting to see.

I'm fortunate enough to know the folks involved in [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj). They're doing incredible work. I'm aware of [Pijul](https://pijul.org/). I see Meta has just announced [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com/). [PlasticSCM](https://www.plasticscm.com/) is really good; I have enormous respect for Pablo and his whole team. I know there are others. If you're interested, I recommend searching YouTube for some good, short introductions to all of them.

All I can say is: Grace has its own design philosophy, and its own perspective on what it should feel like to be using version control, and that's what I'm passionate about. I think of it as a friendly competition to see which one wins with the next generation of developers.

One of them will catch on and get popular soon enough.

## On _HN_, FOSSBro761 says: _"Grace \<something something\> M$ \<something\>..."_

Sigh. Um, OK. So...

If you look at my GitHub or LinkedIn profile you'll see that I work for GitHub, which means that I work for Microsoft. With that said, Grace is a personal side-project. It's probably the case that I wouldn't have thought to start a new version control system without having been at GitHub, but now I've caught the version control bug. (Some people tried to warn me that that happens, but I didn't listen.)

It's a fascinating area to work in, and one that will see exciting innovation in the coming years. Grace's existence does not imply anything at all about GitHub's continued, massive, ongoing ‚ù§Ô∏è and support of Git, or about GitHub's future direction in source control, or about anything else about GitHub.

All opinions and work here is personal, and not endorsed by my employers. (There, I said it.)

_What actually happened was..._

I started thinking about Grace in December 2020, and it became my personal 2021 pandemic lockdown side-project. I invented it. No one told me to invent it, I just did.

I chose .NET because it's what I know and trust, and because trying to write my first, big functional system was challenging enough without also having to learn a new ecosystem at the same time. I chose F# because I wanted to think functionally as I explored.

I chose to do it at all because I realized that _something_ was eventually going to replace Git, and I had some opinions about what that should be, and about what direction we should take as an industry in UX for source control. The only way to communicate that effectively was to start writing code and see if I could build something worthwhile.

That's the origin story. Just a guy who had an idea he couldn't let go of, using good tools that he knows well, and a few tools that he's learning.


## How can I get involved?

Why, thank you for asking. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Everything helps. Feel free to file an Issue in the repo. Please join us over in Discussions.

I'm working right now to get Grace in better shape for debugging for everyone. I confess the debug workflow is very much tailored to me and my local machine at the moment. I'm going to fix that, and when I do, I'll post instructions for how to write code for and debug Grace as easily as possible.
